# **EDK II Minimum Platform Firmware for Intel(R) Platforms**

The Minimum Platform is a software architecture that guides uniform delivery of Intel platforms enabling firmware
solutions for basic boot functionality with extensibility built-in.

Package maintainers for the Minimum Platform projects are listed in Maintainers.txt.

## Overview
The key elements of the architecture are organized into a staged boot approach where each stage has requirements and
functionality for specific use cases. The generic control flow through the boot process is implemented in the
[`MinPlatformPkg`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/MinPlatformPkg).
The generic nature of the tasks performed in MinPlatformPkg lends to reuse across all Intel platforms with no
source modification. Details for any particular board are made accessible to the MinPlatformPkg through a well-defined
statically linked board API. A complete platform solution then consists of the MinPlatformPkg and a compatible board
package.

## Board Naming Convention
The board packages supported by Intel follow the naming convention \<xxx\>OpenBoardPkg where xxx refers to the
encompassing platform name for a particular platform generation. For example, the [`KabylakeOpenBoardPkg`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/KabylakeOpenBoardPkg) contains the
board code for Intel Kaby Lake reference systems. Intel uses the moniker "OpenBoardPkg" to indicate that this package
is the open source board code. A closed source counterpart may exist which simply uses "BoardPkg". Both directly use
the MinPlatformPkg from edk2-platforms.

## Stage Selection
Stage selection is controlled via the PCD `gMinPlatformPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdBootStage` in [`MinPlatformPkg.dec`](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/tree/master/Platform/Intel/MinPlatformPkg/MinPlatformPkg.dec).
The stage should be configured in the board package DSC file to the appropriate value. For example, a board may disable
all advanced features by setting this value to 4 instead of 6. This may be used to improve boot time for a particular
use case. Decrementing the stage can also be used for debug since only the actions required for that stage objective
should be executed. As an example, ACPI initialization is not required for a Stage 3 boot.

The stages are defined as follows:

| Stage  | Functional Objective         | Example Capabilities                                                                               |
| -------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I      | Minimal Debug                | Serial port output, source debug enabled, hardware debugger enabled                                |
| II     | Memory Functional            | Basic hardware initialization necessary to reach memory initialization, permanent memory available |
| III    | Boot to UI                   | Simple console input and output to a UI, UEFI shell                                                |
| IV     | Boot to OS                   | Boot an operating system with the minimally required features                                      |
| V      | Security Enable              | UEFI Secure Boot, TCG measured boot, DMA protections                                               |
| VI     | Advanced Feature Enable      | Firmware update, power management, non-essential I/O                                               |

## Minimum Platform Firmware Solution Stack

## Board Support
* The `KabylakeOpenBoardPkg` contains board implementations for Kaby Lake systems.
* The `PurleyOpenBoardPkg` contains board implementations for Purley systems.
* The `ClevoOpenBoardPkg` contains board implementations for Clevo systems.

## Board Package Organization
The board package follows the standard EDK II package structure with the following additional elements and guidelines:
* Only code usable across more than one board at the root level.
* Board-specific code in a directory. The directory name should match that of the board supported.
* Features not essential to achieve stage 5 or earlier boots are maintained in a Features folder at the appropriate
  level in the package hierarchy.

Shared resources in the package root directory can include interfaces described in header files, library instances,
firmware modules, binaries, etc. The UEFI firmware implementation is built using the process described below from the
board-specific directory.

A board package must implement the board APIs defined in the MinPlatformPkg even if a "NULL" implementation is used to
return back to the minimum platform caller.

**Building with the batch scripts**
KabylakeOpenBoardPkg does not support batch scripts, please use build_bios.py.

For PurleyOpenBoardPkg
1. Open command window, go to the workspace directory, e.g. c:\Purley.
2. Type "cd edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel\PurleyOpenBoardPkg\BoardMtOlympus".
3. Type "GitEdk2MinMtOlympus.bat" to setup GIT environment.
4. Type "bld" to build Purley Mt Olympus board UEFI firmware image, "bld release" for release build, "bld clean" to
   remove intermediate files.

The validated version of iasl compiler that can build MinPurley is 20180629. Older version may generate ACPI build
errors.

For ClevoOpenBoardPkg
1. Open command window, go to the workspace directory, e.g. c:\Clevo.
2. Type "cd edk2-platforms\Platform\Intel\ClevoOpenBoardPkg\N1xxWU".
3. Type "GitEdk2Clevo.bat" to setup GIT environment.
4. Type "bld" to build Clevo UEFI firmware image, "bld release" for release build, "bld clean" to remove intermediate
files.

Users with access to the Intel proprietary FITC tool and ME ingredients can build full images for flash  (BIOS + ME +
DESC).

Users can also flash the UEFI firmware image to the highest area of the flash region directly.

6. The firmware project applies to all Clevo supported board configurations but is only being tested on System 76 Galago
  Pro devices.

### **Planned Activities**
* Replace the batch build scripts with cross-platform Python build scripts.
* Publish a Minimum Platform specification to describe the architecture and interfaces in more detail.

### **Ideas**
If you would like to help but are not sure where to start some areas currently identified for improvement include:
 * Adding board ports for more motherboards and systems
 * Adding Clang support
 * Adding GCC support

Please feel free to contact Michael Kubacki (michael.a.kubacki at intel.com) and Isaac Oram (isaac.w.oram at intel.com)
if you would like to discuss contribution ideas.
